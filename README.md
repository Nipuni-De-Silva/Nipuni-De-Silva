### 👩‍💻 About Me  

I’m a passionate **Full-Stack Software Engineer** from Sri Lanka 🇱🇰, currently pursuing my **BSc Honours in Information and Communication Technology** at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura. I work as an **Associate Software Engineer**, where I build scalable and production-grade applications and AI-powered systems.

🔧 I enjoy designing end-to-end software solutions and have hands-on experience in backend, frontend, system architecture, and AI feature integration. My recent projects include **AI Summarizer**, **Document Chat**, **RAG-based Search Assistants**, and **Agent-to-Agent Protocols** using **FastAPI**, **Spring Boot**, and **Angular**.

🌱 I’m always learning — currently diving deeper into **Cloud Computing (AWS)** and **LLM-based architectures**.

💡 I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and continuously improving through research, collaboration, and feedback.
